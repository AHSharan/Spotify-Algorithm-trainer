# Spotify-Algorithm-trainer
A simple program to fine-tune your Spotify recommendation algorithm.

If you've just transferred to a new account or feel that the Spotify recommendations are not good enough for you, this program can help fine-tune the algorithm. Since there is no direct way to manipulate Spotify's recommendations, we use a workaround by continuously playing music or following a specific pattern to increase the chances that your preferred songs influence the algorithm.

To do this, we can:

Get your favorite albums and songs.
Retrieve data from your previous account to gather your preferred tracks.
After collecting this information, simply start the program and let it run through the entire playlist. Once the process is complete, the next time you play a song, there is an 80% chance that the Spotify algorithm will be fine-tuned to your new favorites.
